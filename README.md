This is a simple task management application that allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are grouped by their status (TODO, DOING, DONE) in different columns.

Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, I faced several challenges, including:

Understanding the data structure: The data structure used in this project was not straightforward, and I had to spend some time understanding how to extract and manipulate the required information.

Managing the state: Keeping track of the active board and updating the UI accordingly was a bit challenging. I had to ensure that the correct board was selected and displayed at all times.

DOM manipulation: Modifying the DOM to display tasks and boards required careful planning and execution. I had to ensure that the existing elements were not affected while adding new ones.

Improvements
Here are some possible improvements for this project:

Add user authentication: Implementing user authentication would allow multiple users to use the application and have their own set of tasks and boards.

Add due dates and reminders: Adding due dates and reminders would help users manage their tasks more efficiently.

Implement drag and drop functionality: Allowing users to drag and drop tasks between columns would provide a better user experience.

Add search and filter functionality: Implementing search and filter functionality would help users find tasks more easily.

What I Learned
During this project, I learned how to:

Manipulate the DOM: I gained more experience in manipulating the DOM using JavaScript.

Work with data structures: I learned how to extract and manipulate data from complex data structures.

Implement event listeners: I improved my skills in implementing event listeners for user interactions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice my JavaScript skills and learn new concepts. Although there are still areas for improvement, I am proud of what I have accomplished. This project has given me the confidence to take on more complex challenges in the future. I hope to continue improving this project and adding new features to it.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have.
